She has experience using complex ecological simulation models to explore fundamental and applied questions related to ecosystem stability to climate change, drought, fire, land-use changes and permafrost thaw. Her research is also strongly focused on the development of integrated, reusable and transparent modelling workflows that can be used not only for research purposes, but also to support and inform end-users within and beyond government. She earned her BSc in Biology from the University of Lisbon, Portugal, and an MSc in Ecology and Environmental Sustainability from the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. She later obtained her PhD in Biodiversity, Ecology and Environment from the University of Grenoble Alps, France, was a post-doctoral fellow and research associate at the Ceres is currently on the British Ecological Society Macroecology SIG committee and on the Response Diversity Network committee, and is an Associate Editor for Ecological Solutions and Evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKiri Daust\n\n\n\n\nKiri Daust, BSc - Data Scientist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanessa Comeau\n\n\n\n\nVanessa Comeau, MSc - Research Ecologist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVivek Srivastava\n\n\n\n\nDr Vivek Srivastava - Data Scientist"
