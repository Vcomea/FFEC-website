She has experience using complex ecological simulation models to explore fundamental and applied questions related to ecosystem stability to climate change, drought, fire, land-use changes and permafrost thaw. Her research is also strongly focused on the development of integrated, reusable and transparent modelling workflows that can be used not only for research purposes, but also to support and inform end-users within and beyond the government.\nShe earned her BSc in Biology from the University of Lisbon, Portugal, and an MSc in Ecology and Environmental Sustainability from the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. She later obtained her PhD in Biodiversity, Ecology and Environment from the University of Grenoble Alps, France, was a post-doctoral fellow and research associate at the University of British Columbia.\nShe currently acts as a committee member of the British Ecological Society Macroecology SIG and the Response Diversity Network, and is an Associate Editor for Ecological Solutions and Evidence.\n\n\n\nKiri Daust, B Sc - Data Scientist\n\n\n\n\nVanessa Comeau, MSc - Research Ecologist\n\n\n\n\nDr Vivek Srivastava - Data Scientist"
